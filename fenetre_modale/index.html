            <p>Leela's gonna kill me. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</p>
            <p>You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? <strong> I'm a thing.</strong> <em> Oh, all right, I am.</em> But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p>
            <h2>Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.</h2>
            <p>There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</p>
            <ol>
            <li>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.</li><li>In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</li><li>Fry, we have a crate to deliver.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</h3>
            <p>The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?</li><li>Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.</li><li>A sexy mistake.</li>

            <p>Large bet on myself in round one. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!</p>
            <p>How much did you make me? I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Bender, we're trying our best. Actually, that's still true.</p>
            <p>Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? I had more, but you go ahead. Who are you, my warranty?! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Why did you bring us here? It's a T. It goes "tuh".</p>
            <p>Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!</p>
            <p>Is that a cooking show? Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</p>
            <p>For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Shut up and take my money! Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</p>
            <p>Anyone who laughs is a communist! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.</p>
            <p>Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. No, I'm Santa Claus! Ask her how her day was. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! What are their names? Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>
            <p>Look, last night was a mistake. Is that a cooking show? I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</p>
            <p>Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?</p>
            <p>Shut up and take my money! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… Bite my shiny metal ass. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?</p>
